   RESPONSIVE HERO SECTION - Detailed Explanation
   =============================================================================

   WHAT IS A HERO SECTION?
   Think of a hero section like the big picture on the front of a storybook.
   It's the first thing people see when they open your website - a big,
   beautiful image that takes up the whole screen!

   ============================================================================= */

.hero-section {
    /*
     * min-height: 100vh
     * ----------------
     * "vh" means "viewport height" - that's how tall your screen is!
     * 100vh = 100% of your screen height
     *
     * Imagine your screen is a window. This says "make this box AT LEAST
     * as tall as the whole window!" So if you have a tiny phone or a huge
     * TV, it will always fill the whole screen from top to bottom.
     *
     * "min-height" means "minimum height" - it can be taller, but never shorter!
     */
    min-height: 100vh;

    /*
     * height: 100vh
     * -------------
     * This also says "be exactly as tall as the screen"
     * We use BOTH min-height and height to make super sure it works
     * on ALL browsers (some old browsers are picky!)
     */
    height: 100vh;

    /*
     * overflow: hidden
     * ----------------
     * Imagine you have a picture frame, but the picture is bigger than the frame.
     * "overflow: hidden" is like using scissors to cut off the parts that
     * stick out! Nothing can peek outside our hero section box.
     *
     * This keeps our image nice and tidy inside its container, no matter
     * how big the original image file is.
     */
    overflow: hidden;
}

.hero-image {
    /*
     * width: 100%
     * -----------
     * This tells the image "stretch yourself to be as wide as your parent!"
     * The parent is .hero-section, which is as wide as the screen.
     * So the image will stretch from the left edge to the right edge.
     *
     * Think of it like stretching a rubber band to fit across a doorway!
     */
    width: 100%;

    /*
     * height: 100%
     * ------------
     * Same idea, but for height! "Be as tall as your parent!"
     * Combined with width: 100%, the image tries to fill the entire
     * hero section box completely.
     */
    height: 100%;

    /*
     * object-fit: cover
     * -----------------
     * THIS IS THE MAGIC PROPERTY! Here's what it does:
     *
     * Imagine you have a rectangular photo of a person, and you want to
     * put it in a square frame. You have three choices:
     *
     * 1. "contain" - Shrink the whole photo to fit inside.
     *    But then you'd have empty space on the sides! (Not good)
     *
     * 2. "fill" - Stretch and squish the photo to fit exactly.
     *    But then the person looks all stretched and weird! (Not good)
     *
     * 3. "cover" - Make the photo big enough to COVER the whole frame,
     *    and cut off the extra parts. The photo keeps its shape, and the
     *    frame is completely filled! (Perfect!)
     *
     * We use "cover" because:
     * - The image keeps its normal proportions (no stretchy people!)
     * - The entire screen is covered (no ugly empty spaces!)
     * - It works on ANY screen size - phones, tablets, giant monitors!
     */
    object-fit: cover;

    /*
     * object-position: center 30%
     * ---------------------------
     * When we use object-fit: cover, some parts of the image get cut off.
     * object-position tells the browser WHICH part of the image to show!
     *
     * Think of it like looking through a window at a big painting:
     * - "center" means "keep the middle of the painting in the middle of the window"
     * - "30%" means "show the part that's 30% down from the top"
     *
     * Why 30%? Because our model's FACE is about 30% from the top of the photo!
     * If we used "top" (0%), we'd only see her hair.
     * If we used "center" (50%), we might cut off her forehead.
     * 30% is the sweet spot where we see her whole beautiful face!
     *
     * The format is: object-position: [horizontal] [vertical]
     * - "center" = horizontally centered (left-right)
     * - "30%" = 30% from the top (up-down)
     */
    object-position: center 30%;

   RESPONSIVE DESIGN - Making it work on ALL screen sizes!
   =============================================================================

   WHAT ARE MEDIA QUERIES?
   Media queries are like asking questions: "Hey browser, how big is the screen?"
   Based on the answer, we can apply different styles!

   @media (max-width: 768px) means:
   "IF the screen is 768 pixels wide or SMALLER, use these special styles"

   WHY DO WE NEED THIS?
   A website that looks great on a big computer monitor might look terrible
   on a tiny phone screen! Media queries let us adjust things for each size.

   BREAKPOINTS (the numbers we check):
   - 1200px = Large laptops and desktops
   - 992px  = Small laptops and tablets in landscape mode
   - 768px  = Tablets in portrait mode
   - 576px  = Mobile phones

   ============================================================================= */

/*
 * LARGE SCREENS (up to 1200px wide)
 * ---------------------------------
 * This is for smaller laptops. The hero section stays full screen height,
 * but we add a minimum height of 600px just in case.
 *
 * Why minimum height? Some laptops have weird aspect ratios, and 100vh
 * might be very short. 600px ensures there's always enough room for our content!

/*
 * MEDIUM SCREENS - TABLETS (up to 992px wide)

 * Tablets have more square-shaped screens compared to wide computer monitors.
 * We adjust the image position to show a bit more of the top of the photo.
